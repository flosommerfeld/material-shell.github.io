    <v-card-text>Material Shell is made Open Source and will remain free for everyone. While this seem amazing, the downside is that it's very difficult to monetize. Until I find another way, I have no choice than rely on all of you. Please sponsor me and I'll make the best desktop experience I can.</v-card-text>
